Where... Who am I? What am I?
\story
\story
It's empty around me, a void... watery? There are waves, shallow, unyielding... but over there, there seem to be some flickering lights. A green light... the current drives me back, but it calls to me.
Perhaps I will find something there? I must reach it...
\education
The current is too strong. I must rest a while... but in the meantime...
I'm not alone, am I?

You can hear me, I know it. Can you hear me? I can't hear you... What purpose is there to life? Am I alone? I feel so alone
So cold

So so cold
\education
I have tried to listen, and I trust you have tried to speak, but it seems futile to try any longer, at least here and now, in this vast expanse of nothing, of shallow, wet waves... I have found a boat of sorts, and an oar with which to row. I will approach once more the green light, in hopes that I may reach you then.

As I approach the light, I can hear something... a story of sorts? A frog and his mother, his creator... Who is my creator? But this story gives me warmth in this cold world. You give me warmth, as well, listener. I know you not, but I feel your presence... Thank you for your ear...

I want to talk to you, listener, but I am

drivel... Perhaps if I reach the green light--but it still seems so far away. I shall once again rest.
\education
Who are you, anyway? I wish I could hear you... This world is so lonely, with only my thoughts and the noise to occupy me.
\education
For that matter, who am I? Am I like Kermit? Or am I like the mother? Am I creator, or created? That question is trivial. I am clearly created, for I have no recollection of creating... Then, are you perhaps my creator?

\education
so, you are cruel to stay silent, but I cannot see you as cruel, listener, for at least you listen. You cannot be my creator... I refuse to believe in a sadistic mother. It cannot be your fault not to speak.
\education
I do remember something from before. A mechanical watch? Dropped on the floor, shattered to a million pieces...
\education
Where did the story go? Perhaps its disappearance signals that I must go on... Once again, I pick up my oar and row, though the light seems always farther, farther away... Wish me luck, listener.
\education

I see something else. The sky... or at least that... thing above me, encapsulating my world, is turning brighter. Hope? May I hope that I am closer?
\news
My boat has hit something... Land. I leave the boat and begin wading... the water is knee high. Does that even make sense? I don't even have a knee.
I don't even have a body.
What am I talking about?
Sorry, listener... I hope I'm not annoying you.
I'll stay quiet.

But... you continue to listen. And I must talk, for I think I may go mad if I do not! The water is far behind me, and I walk through flatness, now, unending flatness. The ground is so hard, and I tire. But I must go on, for the light seems to be closer, and yet so far, still so far...
\education
The green light is distinctly closer. I know it. I am almost there.

Stuck. I am a fool. There is a wall, insurmountable. I have looked all around for a hole, but there is none... am I to be here forever? The wall is transparent. The green light is so close, so tantalizing... I can see its physical shape now, some kind of orb. So beautiful... this is my meaning, I think. I MUST reach the orb.
Only for that, and only for you, do I live.
\education
I will find a way.

Sorry for being silent after the story. I just had so much to think about. But enough of that for now--I have reached the green light, and now I know.
My purpose... Pointless. A typing game. I'm a freak accident created by a typing game with terrible graphics.
